Arcade Game Clone
===============================
This is project #3 for the Front End Nanodegree from Udacity

To run the game download the repository and open the index.html
Or check out the live demo:
http://georgejdli.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/

To play:
Use the arrow keys to move.
Collect gems and bring them to the river to score points.
If you are hit by a bug you lose any gems collected that you did not bring to the river.
You lose one life (a heart) every time a bug hits your player character.
When you lose all your lives the game ends.

High Score tracking is kept using localStorage.
